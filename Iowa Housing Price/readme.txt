Exercising to predict the house price using Decision Tree and Random Forest algorithm. The accuracy of the model is checked by using Mean Absolute Error(MAE). Random Forest algorithm gave us lower MAE than Decision Tree. It means that Random Forest can predict better the house price.

The dataset contains 81 columns. For simplicity of the exercise, I chose the feature to make model by using intuition. The chosen features are 'LotArea', 'YearBuilt', '1stFlrSF', '2ndFlrSF', 'FullBath', 'BedroomAbvGr', 'TotRmsAbvGrd'
